# autodiff
A python framework for reverse mode automatic differentiation.


This is a python framework that leverages automatic differentiation to train deep neural network (like most other deep learning frameworks). I was inspired to try to write my own deep learning framework from (numpy) scratch. In part from working with PyTorch and wanting to better understand the library "under the hood", as well as being inspired by Joel Grus, his talks and YouTube videos on the matter, so I decided to give it a try myself.

Additionally, the book Mathematics for Machine Learning proved to be a very helpful tool and an enjoyable read.
